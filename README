TinyCore MicroKernel API and Sample DOS
---------------------------------------

This project is effectively deprecated:
The latest DOS is at https://github.com/FoenixRetro/f256-dos
The latest kernel is at https://github.com/ghackwrench/F256_MicroKernel
The latest releases of both are at https://github.com/FoenixRetro/f256-firmware
The cc65 toolkit will eventually be moved to its own repo.

OLD README BELOW
----------------

This project exports and documents the TinyCore MicroKernel API as used on the
Foenix F256 line of 6502-based microcomputers. It includes, as part of the
documentation, a simple command line "DOS"-style shell which demonstrates how
each of the kernel calls are used.  Readers are expected and encouraged to
copy, paste, and modify any and all parts of this program for their own use
without any form of implied license baggage.  To the extent that the shell
proves useful in its own right, it shall be considered a community supported
and maintained application.  - Jessie Oberreuter, 2022.
